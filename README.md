# MS SQL Data Analysis Project

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on performing data analysis using **Microsoft SQL Server**.
The goal is to practice real-world SQL skills such as database creation,
data import, schema design, and exploratory data analysis using a structured,
step-by-step approach.

## 🗂️ Dataset
- **Source:** CSV files (manually imported into MS SQL Server)
- **Data Type:** Sales / Customers data

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies
- Microsoft SQL Server
- SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS)
- Git & GitHub

## 🏗️ Work Completed So Far

### Day 1 – Database Setup & Initial Exploration
- Created the database
- Imported CSV files into SQL Server
- Designed and created the database schema
- Performed initial database exploration:
  - Table structure analysis
  - Row count checks
  - Basic `SELECT` queries

### Day 2 – Data & Time-Based Exploration
- Performed **dimension exploration** to identify the number of distinct values
  in important columns across all tables
- Conducted **date exploration** to understand data boundaries:
  - First order date: **2010**
  - Last order date: **2014**
  - Total data timespan: **4 years**
- Analyzed **age distribution** within the dataset:
  - Minimum age: **40**
  - Maximum age: **110**
- Gained a clear understanding of:
  - Data scope
  - Time coverage
  - Data limitations before deeper analysis

## 🔍 Sample SQL Tasks Performed
- Viewing table structures
- Exploring data distributions
- Checking null values
- Counting distinct values in columns
- Identifying minimum and maximum dates
- Understanding relationships between tables

## 🚀 Upcoming Work
- Advanced SQL queries (JOINs, GROUP BY, HAVING)
- Business-focused analysis
- KPI calculations
- Trend and performance analysis
- Query optimization
- Documentation of insights and conclusions

## 📌 Project Status
🟢 **Project in progress** (Active learning & analysis phase)
